% Test a case where the matrix has sub-blocks which are zero. This matrix
% has an inverse, but the code prior to April 2022 could not compute it
% because of NaNs (the new code uses adjoint/unadjoint to work around
% this). The result is exact because all the quaternions in A have values
% of zero or one.
