function str = char(q)
% CHAR Create character array (string).
% (Quaternion overloading of standard Matlab function.)

% Note: the Matlab char function converts arrays of numeric values into
% character strings. This is not what this function does, but the Matlab
% guidance on user-defined classes suggests writing a char function and
% a disp/display function. This advice has been followed.

% TODO Merge this code into DISP. The advice mentioned above is now
% obsolete, in particular the overloading of DISPLAY is not now
% recommended. There is no need for a CHAR function. CAUTION test_qfft.m
% calls char to format a string for error output, so this function is
% needed, and removing it would require the test code to be modifiied.

% There are three cases to be handled. The argument is one of: empty, a
% pure quaternion, a full quaternion.

if isempty(q)
    str = '[] quaternion'; % This case must be handled first because an
    return;                % empty quaternion is not scalar, and the
end                        % next check would fail.

end

% TODO The format here should be dependent on the current setting of the
% format (using the format command). This can be obtained using f = get(0,
% 'format') but unfortunately it returns a string like 'Short' rather than
% a C-style format code. There doesn't seem to be a built-in way to map one
% to the other, so we would have to do it here, with a switch statement.

f = '%.4g'; % Control over the format of each numeric value.

% Lines of greater than about 5950 characters seem to cause text overwrite
% in the MATLAB command window. To prevent this from happening, we insert a
% newline after component of the quaternion if the length exceeds 5000.
% This doesn't fix a problem if one component has a length greater than
% 5000, but that is done in the MATLAB char function. (Long strings are
% only likely in the symbolic case.)
