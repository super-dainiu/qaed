% We need to test here that eqn is a symbolic expression representing a
% quaternion equation. This is tricky because it is actually an expression
% involving the components of a quaternion, and contains no quaternions. So
% we want to be sure it has 3 or 4 subexpressions combined by &.
% Unfortunately we don't seem to be able to access the operands in the
% expression (to check for &), so we resort to rebuilding the expression
% from its subexpressions and testing for equality. Clunky workaround!

% TODO Is there any case where the eqn could have 3 components? (I.e. a
% pure quaternion expression.)

r = solve([subexpr{:}], [scalar(var), x(var), y(var), z(var)]);

% r will be a struct, with fields named according to the variables which
% make up the quaternion variable var. We need to convert this struct into
% a quaternion. The trick for doing this is taken from Matlab Central
% answers 229604 by 'Guillaume' 13 Jul 2015.
