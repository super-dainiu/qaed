    % TODO (Due to Eckhard Hitzer, 24 August 2015, in relation to the LU
    % function in the Clifford Toolbox for MATLAB). Consider whether the
    % pivoting scheme can be adapted to take account of divisors of zero,
    % similar to the way it avoids zero or very small pivots. This will not
    % make any difference with real quaternion matrices because there are no
    % divisors of zero.
    
    % Partial pivoting: place the largest element in the column from (j, j)
    % downwards at position (j, j) (taking largest to mean largest modulus)
    % by swapping rows. We use abs twice so that the modulus of a complex
    % quaternion array A yields a real result, so the code will work for
    % biquaternion arrays.
    
    % The subsref here extracts A(j:n, j), the column below and including
    % A(j, j).
    [~, k] = max(abs(abs(subsref(A, substruct('()', {j:N, j})))));

    if k ~=1 % If k == 1, the largest element is already at A(j, j).
        % Swap rows j and j + k - 1 in A and corresponding indices in IP.
        l = j + k - 1;
        IP([j l]) = IP([l j]);
        r1 = substruct('()', {[j l], ':'});
        r2 = substruct('()', {[l j], ':'});
        A = subsasgn(A, r1, subsref(A, r2)); % A([j l], :) = A([l j], :)
    end
    
    if j == m, break, end % If true, j+1:m would be an empty range.
    s1 = substruct('()', {j,     j});
    s2 = substruct('()', {j+1:m, j});
    %A(j+1:m, j) = A(j+1:m, j) ./ A(j, j);
    A = subsasgn(A, s2, subsref(A, s2) ./ subsref(A, s1));
    
    if j == n, break, end % If true, j+1:n would be an empty range.
    s3 = substruct('()', {j+1:m, j+1:n});
    s4 = substruct('()', {j,     j+1:n});
    %A(j+1:m, j+1:n) = A(j+1:m, j+1:n) - A(j+1:m, j) * A(j, j+1:n);

% The algorithm above computes L and U in place, so extract them into the
% separate results demanded by the calling profile. The diagonal of L is
% implicit in the result produced above, so we have to supply the explicit
% values which are all ones.

% L has size [m, N],     where N = min(m, n), the number of elements on the
% U has size [N, n]      diagonal of A.

U = triu(subsref(A, substruct('()', {1:N, ':'})));        % U = triu(A(1:N,:));
L = tril(subsref(A, substruct('()', {':', 1:N})), -1) ... % L = tril(A(:,1:N));
    + eye(m, N, 'like', A.x);

if nargout == 3
    % The permutation matrix P is needed. At present we have a vector of
    % index values in IP, which we can use to construct P by permuting an
    % identity matrix.

    P = eye(m); P = P(IP, :);
else
    % Output parameter P is not needed, therefore we must modify L, by
    % permuting rows using the indices in IP. This is equivalent to
    % multiplication of L on the left by P.'. This ensures that A == L * U,
    % rather than P * A == L * U, which is the case if P is returned.

    [~, IX] = sort(IP); % TODO Can we avoid the sort?
    L = subsref(L, substruct('()', {IX, ':'})); % L = L(IX, :);
end

% Note on subscripted references: these do not work inside a class method
% (which this is). See the file 'implementation notes.txt', item 8.

% TODO Consider adding support for the additional calling profiles where
% the permutation information is returned as a vector. The above code has
% been changed to use a vector as an intermediate step towards this (it
% doesn't appear to save any time, but it will cut down on memory usage if
% P is not returned).
