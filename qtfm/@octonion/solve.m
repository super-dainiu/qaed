% TODO A major issue here is parentheses. An octonion expression must be
% parenthesised, but when evaluated into eight expressions involving
% complex numbers, the parentheses are no longer needed, and must be
% removed, otherwise the MATLAB SOLVE may not be able to make any progress.
% This can be done with EXPAND. Is it possible to detect that an expression
% contains parentheses, and warn the user that EXPAND may be needed?

% TODO Support the parameter profiles with Name/Value pairs, assuming it
% makes sense and that we can pass them to the individual solve calls on
% the components of the quaternion equation.

% The second parameter must be an octonion, since if it isn't, and the
% first would pass the test above, this function would not be called.

% We need to test here that eqn is a symbolic expression representing an
% octonion equation. This is tricky because it is actually an expression
% involving the components of an octonion, and contains no octonions. So
% we want to be sure it has 7 or 8 subexpressions combined by &.
% Unfortunately we don't seem to be able to access the operands in the
% expression (to check for &), so we resort to rebuilding the expression
% from its subexpressions and testing for equality. Clunky workaround!

% TODO Is there any case where the eqn could have 7 components? (I.e. a
% pure octonion expression.)

% r will be a struct, with fields named according to the variables which
% make up the octonion variable var. We need to convert this struct into
% an octonion. The trick for doing this is taken from Matlab Central
% answers 229604 by 'Guillaume' 13 Jul 2015.
