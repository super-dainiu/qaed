function R = inv(a)
% INV   Inverse of an octonion (matrix).
% (Octonion overloading of standard Matlab function.)

% TODO For a single octonion, this code works, but for matrices, we could
% add 'L' and 'R' parameters, and call linv or rinv as appropriate, with a
% warning if neither is specified. A third option would be to use [L, R] as
% the result, and compute both. Calling code can use [L, ~] or [~, R] to
% compute one only.
