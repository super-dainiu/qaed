<short>Two-Sided Quaternion Fast Fourier transform</short>
<syntax>Y = qfft2ds(X, A)</syntax>
<long>
<para>
<code>qfft2ds(X, A)</code> computes a two-sided Quaternion Fast Fourier Transform
of the quaternion matrix <code>X</code> using transform axis pair <code>A</code>
(direction in 3-space).
</para>
<para>
The transform axis pair, <code>A</code> must be a cell array of two elements
which are pure quaternions (real or complex).
They need not have unit modulus (although the transform itself
is computed using a unit-modulus axis, so that the axis is a root of -1).
</para>
    <para>
        The transform computed by this function is a slight generalization
        of that of Ell (1992)., which had fixed transform axes of <bold>j</bold>
        and <bold>k</bold> for the left and right exponentials. The related
        function <code>fft2ds</code> provides the default axes of Ell's
        original transform.
    </para>
<para>
This function is computed by fast Fourier transforms.
The related function <code>qdft2ds</code> computes the same result by a
    much slower discrete Fourier transform. It is provided for test and
    verification purposes (the result is less accurate than the fast transform
    code, but it should differ by only small multiples of the machine rounding).
</para>
    <para>
        The inverse function is <code>iqfft2ds</code> and it has the same calling
        profile. It differs however, in applying a scale factor of 1/N where
        N is the number of elements in the array <code>X</code> (the product
        of the number of rows and the number of columns).
